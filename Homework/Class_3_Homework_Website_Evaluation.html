        <h1>Max And His Top 3</h1>
        <br/>
            <h2>Number #1</h2>
            <ul>
                <ui><p>Hotschedules.com</p></ui>
                    <ui><p1>The first site I visited was <b>hotschedules.com</b> it is the website that I frequent the most. I use this for work, mostly checking my schedule, trading and dropping my shifts, as well as any other communication regarding work. what I like the most about this website is customization  to each individual and ease of communication. It has a solid blue navigation bar at the top of the page and the body consist of all the important information for the user. It uses a very Monochromatic color scheme with one solid base color and two side live text boxes on the right of the page for quick messaging and communication. The primary color is a blue with a splash of grey which is a change from the green I was acustom before the most recent update. This makes more sense because they are marketing this to other business. The general mood and feeling from this is very offical but dull. It is very well catered to each individual throughout the body and side message boxes. This websight provides an efficent platform to achieve the users goal but leaves behind a bit of the users experience behind.</p1></ui>
            </ul>
        <h2>Number #2</h2>
            <ul>
                <ui><p>Reddit.com</p></ui>
                    <ui><p1>For my second website I went to <b>reddit.com</b> this page is great social news website that allows users to post links, vote on post, discuss post and communicate about almost anything. They use a page ranking system that uses visitors up votes to determine the top post at the top of the page. The main color scheme is again a Monochromatic using two different shades blue the first very dark/true blue and the second being a lot more whimsical or soft. The use of the two colors provides nice highlights to titles of the post and an image of what they are. The goal of voting is rather easy to accomplish but posting can be a bit confusing. I would rate the functionality good but the experience a bit confusing.</p1></ui>
            </ul>
        <h2>Number #3</h2>
            <ul>
                <ui><p>Spotify.com</p></ui>
                    <ui><p1>The last website I visited was <b>Spotify.com</b> this is the website use to listen to music, podcast, and just about anything else audio wise. The website has a very simple navigation bar at the top and completely customized music boxes for you running the entire length of the page. There are no advertisements as this is pay to play website for me but im sure if you have the free version there is. It has a learning capability that suggest not only recently played music but new much the user may want to hear. The color scheme is analogous with many colors. There are many colors but they are used wisely and blended very well. The functionality is great and very easy to use. The user is experience is great and fun to explore.    </p1></ui>
